# open.py

Open a file from the command line with an appropriate viewer.

## Examples:

``open.py image.png``

Opens an image in the image viewer.

``open.py www.yahoo.com``

Opens an URL in the web browser.

``open.py``

Opens the current folder in the file manager.

``open.py /Path to/My File.pdf``

Path and file names can have spaces in them, no backslashes or quotes needed. This simplifies pasting a file name e.g. as printed by the Linux ``locate`` command.
